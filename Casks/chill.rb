  # No install or uninstall hooks, by design: cask steps run sandboxed, and
  # SMAppService refuses a sandboxed caller, so no step can register or
  # unregister chilld. The app registers it from its popover; when the app is
  # deleted, chilld hands the fans to Apple and removes itself and its files.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Open chill from Applications and press "install chilld" in its popover,
    then approve it once under System Settings > General > Login Items &
    Extensions. chilld is the root daemon, the only thing that writes to the
    fans.
